# Statistic-ShinyFrame
A simple shiny framework (ui design) for multi-statistic analysis 

First, I shoud thanks to [Scottish Public Health Observatory](https://github.com/ScotPHO), the origin version of this framework is from 
[https://github.com/ScotPHO/scotpho-profiles-tool](https://github.com/ScotPHO/scotpho-profiles-tool), and I just rebuild and modulize it with [golem](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/)'s pipeline
so that it's suitable for constructing various statistical analysis tool. 

* Home module is used to show homepage.
* StatMethod module is used to design various statistical methods
* Other modules make shinyTool more friendly to visit for users

I also design a StatMethod_1 module as an example that can be used in other modules with some modifications
